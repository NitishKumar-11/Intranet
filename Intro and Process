#Definition

An intranet is a private network contained within an enterprise that is used to securely share company information and computing resources among employees.
An intranet can also be used for working in groups and teleconferences.
Intranets encourage communication within an organization. They let employees easily access important information, links, applications, forms and databases of company records.
A database that includes all the usernames of employees who have access rights to the network is often used to maintain intranet security.

#How it works?
A secure and reliable intranet requires a web server that manages requests for data hosted on the server. The web server finds requested files and delivers them to the appropriate user.
A content management system should also be set up to control the creation, publication and management of intranet content.
An intranet may also consist of many interlinked local area networks (LANs), as well as leased lines connecting to wide area network resources. The intranet's web server uses TCP/IP, HTTP and other internet protocols.
Typically, an intranet includes connections through one or more gateway computers to the outside internet and external resources.
